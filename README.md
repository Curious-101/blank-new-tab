Inspired by [Minimal New Tab](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/minimal-new-tab/khdnagehanbomfdogegmpddmcalmdnbg) by [MK Projects](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/search?developer=MK%20Projects). Blank New Tab is very similar, but uses Edge's default new tab favicon (from Microsoft [Fluent UI System Icons](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons)) and has localization for some languages. To give an even slightly more seamless experience.

Features:

* Blank new tab page.
* Visual integrity with built-in Edge settings pages.
* Light and dark mode, depending on the browser theme.
* Default Edge new tab favicon and page title.
* Localized page title, depending on the browser language.

Chrome/Edge extensions can't override the Incognito/InPrivate new tab page.

Supported languages:

* English
* Polish
* Czech
* German
* Dutch
* Norwegian
* Swedish
* Finnish
* Danish
* French
* Spanish
* Italian
* Portugese
* Chinese
* Japanese
* Korean
